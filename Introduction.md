This is the first version of the agent based modelling portfolio.
It sets up two agents, walks them one step in a 100 x 100 grid and
calculates the Euclidian distance between them.

To run it:
1. Download this file
2. Open it with the Python Shell
3. Select Run, then Run Module

This will display the starting locations of the variables at 50 50, the
the location of agents 1 and 2 after walking one step from randomly generated
starting locations, and the distance between them.
