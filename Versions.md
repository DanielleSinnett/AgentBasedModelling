# Evolution of the agent based model

Here you can download the earlier versions of the agent based model, as follows:

1. Walking two agents one step [here](https://daniellesinnett.github.io/model.py)
2. Walking two one step and plotting their final location [here](https://daniellesinnett.github.io/model2.py)
3. Walking ten agents one hundred steps and plotting their final location [here](https://daniellesinnett.github.io/model3.py)
4. Making the ten agents eat their environment [here](https://daniellesinnett.github.io/model4.py)
5. Making them share with neighbours [here](https://daniellesinnett.github.io/model5.py)

You can download the code and follow the instructions; but to run 4 and 5 you will also need to download the [Agent class](https://daniellesinnett.github.io/agentframework.py)

You can return to the final model [here](https://daniellesinnett.github.io/finalmodel.py)
